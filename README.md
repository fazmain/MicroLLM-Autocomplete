## MicroLLM-Autocomplete

This project wants to develop a context-aware on-device text response prediction system that leverages a mi-
croLLM—compact, distilled versions of full-scale Large Language Models—to deliver real-
time, personalized text suggestions while ensuring data privacy and efficient resource utiliza-
tion. The project draws inspiration from widely adopted smart compose systems, such as
Gmail’s predictive text feature, and aims to extend these capabilities to mobile platforms
through model distillation, quantization, and continual on-device fine-tuning
